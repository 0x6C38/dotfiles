# KDE
## Add shortcut to switch between desktops "there is no shortcut to change desktop"
You can add it. Global shortcuts -> System Settings Module -> different kinds of switching Or left click on a Pager -> Configure Desktops -> Switchings and choose it there. 


## Add a shortcut to drag windows to another desktop"no shortcut to drag your windows to another desktop 
You can add it. Global shortcuts -> System Settings Module -> Window to Desktop "alt tab doesn't include windows from every desktop" You can change it. Task Switcher -> Filter windows by and uncheck Virtual desktops 

## "When you type in the menu and search for an application it opens up a new window by default and if you configure it to open only one instance it does so, but only if the other instances are on the same desktop" 

Isn't it per program dependant? Tried Smplayer(1 instance mode enabled), opened in desktop 1 tried to open in desktop 2 KDE switched to desktop 1 to already opened Smplayer. 

To change application launcher type:
- unlock widgets ->  right click logo ->  alternatives

## Num-pad is off when the computer starts
Something [here](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/solved-how-to-turn-on-numlock-on-boot-on-plasma/8301/2) solved the issue.

# Media drive mounting
Look for the drive's UUID via lsblk and then mount the drive to some location (which must exist) and then create an entry in the /etc/fstab file using noatime. This line should work by replacing sdb1 with the name of the drive and /run/media/dsalvio/Media with the desired mount point.

    echo "UUID=$(lsblk -no UUID /dev/sdb1) /run/media/dsalvio/Media $(lsblk -no FSTYPE /dev/sdb1) defaults,noatime 0 2" >> /etc/fstab
