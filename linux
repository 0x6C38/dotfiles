# Aplications
## General
- git
- sbt
- htop / gtop
- zsh
- emacs + spacemacs + adobe-source-code-pro-fonts
- vim
- ranger + w3m + trash-cli (sudo easy_install trash-cli)
- keepass/keepassxc + xdotools
- youtube-dl

### Optional
- peek (record screen and make gif)
- ttyrec (recording terminal actions and playing them back)

## Fonts
- powerline fonts (https://github.com/powerline/fonts)
- ttf-font-awesome

## Japanese Input
- fcitx-im (all)
- fcitx-mozc

Must also add and configure input methods in fcitx-configtool (add mozc) and also shortcuts. May be necssary to mess with the composition mode. May also be necessary to add the following to the .xinitrc file

     export GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx
     export QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx
     export XMODIFIERS="@im=fcitx"

## Numpad on boot
There are two components to having the numpad activated on boot. The first is the console activation which can be done by:

    sudo systemctl edit getty\@.service

    [Service]
    ExecStartPre=/bin/sh -c 'setleds +num < /dev/%I'

And the second is the display manager's activation. In case of X.org, numpadx can be installed and executed on ~/.xinitrc so that it works with startx:

    sudo pacman -S numlockx
    vim ~./.xinitrc

    numlockx &

    exec window_manager

# KDE
## Add shortcut to switch between desktops "there is no shortcut to change desktop"
You can add it. Global shortcuts -> System Settings Module -> different kinds of switching Or left click on a Pager -> Configure Desktops -> Switchings and choose it there. 


## Add a shortcut to drag windows to another desktop"no shortcut to drag your windows to another desktop 
You can add it. Global shortcuts -> System Settings Module -> Window to Desktop "alt tab doesn't include windows from every desktop" You can change it. Task Switcher -> Filter windows by and uncheck Virtual desktops 

## "When you type in the menu and search for an application it opens up a new window by default and if you configure it to open only one instance it does so, but only if the other instances are on the same desktop" 

Isn't it per program dependant? Tried Smplayer(1 instance mode enabled), opened in desktop 1 tried to open in desktop 2 KDE switched to desktop 1 to already opened Smplayer. 

To change application launcher type:
- unlock widgets ->  right click logo ->  alternatives

## Num-pad is off when the computer starts
Something [here](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/solved-how-to-turn-on-numlock-on-boot-on-plasma/8301/2) solved the issue.

# Media drive mounting
Look for the drive's UUID via lsblk and then mount the drive to some location (which must exist) and then create an entry in the /etc/fstab file using noatime. This line should work by replacing sdb1 with the name of the drive and /run/media/dsalvio/Media with the desired mount point.

    echo "UUID=$(lsblk -no UUID /dev/sdb1) /run/media/dsalvio/Media $(lsblk -no FSTYPE /dev/sdb1) defaults,noatime 0 2" >> /etc/fstab 

Make sure ntfs-3g is installed since linux struggles with some ntfs variations.

By default root may take ownership of the mounted folder so it may be necessary to take measures to provide other users with access. This may be done via configuration in the fstab file or by taking ownership of the mounted drive:

    sudo chown -R myUserName: /media/MD

It's possible that the media drive may be set to read only because of windows. If that's the case, switch to windows and disable hibernation as well as fast start up.
